# Smart Contract Coordinated Privacy Preserving Crowd-Sensing Campaigns

This repository contains the implementation of the solution proposed in the paper:

> **"Smart Contract Coordinated Privacy Preserving Crowd-Sensing Campaigns"**  
> *Luca Bedogni and Stefano Ferretti, 2024*

The project demonstrates how smart contracts can be used to coordinate privacy-preserving crowd-sensing campaigns, ensuring accountability and incentivization while protecting user privacy.
